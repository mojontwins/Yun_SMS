Quick and dirty reference for mkts in 'scripted' mode.
======================================================

General commands:

Use these before you do anything, otherwise you must know that stupid scripts do stupid things.

MAPFILE out.h 			- Stuff will be output there
LABEL label 			- Use as suffix/prefix/infix in labels
CHAROFFSET c 			- Offset by this quantity in the MAPFILE.

OPEN file.png			- Opens a new file for reading.
PALS file.png			- Establishes this palette as active [NES]
PALS ABCD 				- Establishes this palette as active [GB]

Metasprite processing:

METASPRITE X0, Y0, WC, HC, OX, OY [FLIPPED|MIRRORED]

						- X0, Y0: where to cut (in chars)
						- WC, HC: rectangle size (in chars)
						- OX, OY: metasprite origin, negative is left/upwards.
						- FLIPPED: like genflipped.
						- MIRRORED: Use instead of FLIPPED if your sprite has the origin in the horizontal center.

More to come in the future.
